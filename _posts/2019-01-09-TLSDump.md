    To intercept an HTTPS session with mitmproxy and to inspect in wireshark.
---

I'm trying to examine HTTP/2 traffic recently, as the HTTP/2 transmission is encrypted with TLS, I set up mitmproxy to intercept and forward HTTP/2 requests.



## Reverse Proxy Mode
When in reverse proxy mode, mitmproxy works as a target website. It's easy to intercept HTTPS connections between a local client and the target website.
```
mitmproxy --mode reverse:https://http2.github.io --showhost  --ssl-insecure 
```
Then, to use curl as a client to access the local 8080 directly.
```
curl --http2-prior-knowledge -v https://127.0.0.1:8080 --header "Host:http2.github.io" --insecure
```

The HTTPS sessions can also be dumped to a pcap with tcpdump, and examined later in Wireshark. 

```
tcpdump host http2.github.io -w http2.pcap
```

As Wireshark needs *TLS master secrets* to decrypt captured HTTPS session packets in the pcap file, MITMProxy can export these secrets by setting an SSLKEYLOGFILE env variable.
```
SSLKEYLOGFILE=$HOME/.mitmproxy/sslkeylogfile.txt mitmdump --mode reverse:https://http2.github.io --showhost  --ssl-insecure -w h2.mitm
```

Then, curl the target website again, and configure the sslkeyfile in Wireshark.


## Transparent Proxy Mode
In this mode, mitmproxy works as a man in the middle, it can intercept traffics to any websites.

First, enable IP forwarding and turn on Port direction:
```
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
ip6tables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
ip6tables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
```

Then, start mitmproxy in transparent mode.
```
mitmproxy --mode transparent --showhost --ssl-insecure
```

Note that, the PREROUTING table only applies to packets coming from outside, if the HTTPS client and the mitmproxy are running on the same machine, we have to use iptables to modify the tdport on OUTPUT chain.
However, this dport modification will affect all packets sent out from our machine, thus affect packets sent out from mitmproxy too. To bypass this problem, mitmproxy can be started as a root process, while iptables only apply to non-root processes, as it's been discussed in [github](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/630).

```
sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner ! --uid-owner root --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner ! --uid-owner root --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
```








# Caveat
## CA
The mitmproxy CA cert is generated at first start in ~/.mitmproxy, this CA is used for generating on-the-fly certificates for each TLS sessions. 


## To intercpet on more ports
```
-m multiport --dports to intercept multiple ports 
```

## Cannot validate certificate hostname without SNI #1846
https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1846 
```
The problem is as follows: When mitmproxy connects upstream, it verifies the certificate the server presents. One part of the verification is to check if the certificate matches the hostname the client is expecting. Modern versions of TLS mandate the client to send a Server Name Indication (SNI) extension during the TLS handshake which names the expected site. However, if your client does not send a SNI extension, there's no way for us to verify the authenticity of the server's certificate as we don't know which site the client is expecting and we fail the connection in the way you described. You can work around this by disabling certificate verification with mitmproxy --insecure - be warned that you are subject to man-in-the-middle attacks then.
```

## Internet connections
There is an option in mitmproxy called block_global: Block connections from globally reachable networks, as defined in the IANA special purpose registries. 
Default: True
https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-options/
You could try to set this option as false: mitmdump --set block_global=false

## Event log
From the mitmproxy console, type :console.view.eventlog
